**Note: There is currently a bug in Smashrun's API that affects certain PUT functionality.
This affects the ability to edit certain fields when editing a run.**

#Running the app:
1) Create an android virtual device (AVD) in Android Studio (Ex: Pixel 4 XL API 30)
2) Login with these dummy account credentials:
email: tub517@psu.edu
password: testAccount
3) Click the back button once authenticated
4) To verify add run, edit run, and delete run functionality, you can login to smashrun.com with the same credentials and verify the changes.
